This project utilizes Spring Boot to create a REST API focused on modify and creating data on database systems. 
I utlised a POSTGRESQL to connect with severs. For the backend, I utilized REACT and Materia UI in create a simple operational interactive component.

To view this project in its entirety, set up the backend through the following steps:
- Clone this repository
- cd into the backend and demo folder and depending on your IDE, run the application
- Using this <http://localhost:8080/client> you should be able to see what is contained in the database.

While this is running, cd into the frontend folder.
- In your terminal, type <npm start>
- This would create the frontend site where you can interact with the site and view the changes on the database.
